A website to store important information like Driving License Number. The front end was created using html and css and the form validation was done using Javascript. The website lets you create a new account or login too an already existing account. Once created, information like credit card numbers or aadhar number can be stored and accessed anytime. PHP is the scripting language used to access the database. I used a local Mysql database running on XAMPP.
